I won the lotto! Sadly, not the powerball 100 million. But I did gain entry into the United Airlines NYC half marathon for 2019. This is exciting news, because a) I’ve never won a lotto before and b) it’s a stepping stone to my longer term running goal of qualifying for the Boston Marathon before I turn 40 (in 2020).


I’ve only raced one half marathon before, and completed the course in 1:27. To qualify for Boston, I need a full marathon time of 3:05. Ideally, I’d be under 3:00 to ensure I make it in. So for that to be a reality, I’ve set a goal for the NYC half to be 1:24. 


I’ve decided to blog my progress. Mainly to keep track of what’s going on with my training, and as a reminder of when I need to plan these races. This post alone has made me realize that I have to run a marathon in the next year, and it needs to be basically be pretty close to the qualifying time. Yikes!


Back to the half. My plan for this half is to follow the Pfitzinger 12/47 plan. A 12 week plan with a peak mileage of 47 miles. I’ll try to do a post where I plan out my week, and then a recap of how that week went.
